# EXCEL-GLOBAL-HAPPINESS-DASHBOARD
IN THIS PROJECT I HAVE USED THE DATA OF THE GLOBAL HAPPINESS REPORT FOR THE YEAR OF 2015 TO 2019. I HAVE USED EXCEL FUNCTIONS LIKE THE PIVOT TABLE, CHARTS , KPI CARDS , VLOOK-UP AND SLICERS TO CREATE A MEANINGFUL INSIGHT ON THE LIST OF TOP 10 MOST HAPPIEST COUNTRIES, 10 MOST UNHAPPIEST COUNTRIES, THEIR TOTAL GDP AND THEIR CORRUPTION RATE.
THIS INSIGHTS CAN BE VERY USEFUL FOR ANY INVESTORS AS THEY CAN EASILY DECIDE WHICH IS THE BEST COUNTRY TO INVEST.
ACCORDING TO THE INSIGHTS I HAVE GOT I CAN CONCLUDE THAT NORWAY IS THE BEST COUNTRY FOR THE INVESTMENT AS THEIR GDP IS HIGH BUT THEIR CORRUPTION RATE IS MUCH LOW COMPARED TO ANY OTHER HIGHER GDP COUNTRY
